## 1.0 Introduction
Alan Turing's famous essay "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" is greatly regarded in the field of Artificial Intelligence. While his thesis is correct, his argument is flawed in many ways. From a modern perspective, it is also fairly primitive. In this paper, I will attempt to disect his work, identify significant flaws, and offer improvements. Additionally, when useful, I will discuss new relevant evidence that has been produced since the original work. In doing so, I attempt not to dismiss the validity or value of the original work, but to strengthen Turing's thesis beyond any doubt. Machines are, beyond a doubt, capable of true intelligence, human-like and otherwise.
