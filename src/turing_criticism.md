## 1.0 Introduction { #intro }
Alan Turing's famous essay "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" is 
greatly regarded in the field of Artificial Intelligence. While his 
thesis is correct, his argument is flawed in many ways. From a modern 
perspective, it is also fairly primitive. In this paper, I will attempt 
to dissect his work, identify significant flaws, and offer 
improvements. Additionally, when useful, I will discuss new relevant 
evidence that has been produced since the original work. In doing so, I 
attempt not to dismiss the validity or value of the original work, but 
to strengthen Turing's thesis beyond any doubt. Machines are definitely and provably capable of true intelligence, human-like and otherwise.
