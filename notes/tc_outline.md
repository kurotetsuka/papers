 - introduction
 - minor criticisms
	 - lack of brevity
	 - failure to define used terms
 - major criticisms
	 - incorrect assumptions
		 - human intelligence is the only form of intelligence
		 - intelligence may only be demonstrated through communication
			 - autistic humans, whales
		 - our world is not the only world
		 - ability to understand the world the way we understand it is not paramount
	 - indirectness of proof
		 - avoidance and misdirection
		 - he admits his lack of evidence
		 - he fairly successfully dismisses counter arguments
	 - dismissal of the mathematical objection
	 - dismissal of the lovelace objection
 - corrections
	 - modern definitions of terms 'machine' and 'intelligence'
		 - permits the refrasing of the question to "are machines capable of intelligence" or "can minds be synthesized"
	 - discrete state machines are not the only universal machines, just the most easily programmed
		 - discrete state machines are capable of emulating any mechanism
		 - any emulation in inefficient
		 - such an approach is ineffective, yet theoretically feasible
 - improvements
	 - proof of intelligence through ability to learn to play games
		 - more general
		 - imitation game may be included
		 - flexibility of game learning may be measured and compared
		 - depth of game learning may be measured and compared
		 - universal and complete
		 - indeed, many modern AI techniques may be considered to take this approach
 - additions
	 - propose definition of 'mind' to be "the unit of an intelligent mechanism"
		 - human mind units, mouse mind units, fly mind units
		 - permits measurement of intelligence
	 - traffic light
 - short proof
 - conclusion
