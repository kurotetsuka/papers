## outline for turing_criticism.md
 - introduction
 - minor criticisms
	 - lack of brevity
	 - failure to define used terms
 - major criticisms
	 - incorrect assumptions
		 - human intelligence is not the only form of intelligence
		 - intelligence is not exlusively demonstrated through communication
			 - autistic humans, whales
		 - our world is not the only world
		 - ability to understand the world the way we understand it is not paramount
	 - indirectness of proof
		 - avoidance and misdirection
		 - he admits his lack of evidence
		 - he fairly successfully dismisses counter arguments
	 - dismissal of the mathematical objection
	 - dismissal of the lovelace objection
 - corrections
	 - modern definitions of terms 'machine' as "sythetic mechanism" and 'intelligence' as "ability to recognize and manipulate patterns"
		 - permits the refrasing of the question "can machines think" to the clearer "can the ability to reconize and manipulate patterns be synthesized"
	 - discrete state machines are not the only universal machines, just the most easily programmed
		 - discrete state machines are capable of emulating any mechanism
		 - any emulation in inefficient
		 - such an approach is ineffective, yet theoretically feasible
		 - present work on neural turing machines
 - improvements
	 - proof of intelligence through ability to learn to play games
		 - more general
		 - imitation game may be included
		 - quality of play may be measured and compared
		 - speed of improvement
		 - flexibility of game learning may be measured and compared
		 - depth of game learning may be measured and compared
		 - universal and complete
		 - performance may be directly compared with natural intelligent mechanisms
		 - indeed, many modern AI techniques may be considered to be taking this approach. presently, most such techniques are inflexible, slow, and shallow. ( mention cortical learning algorithm )
 - additions
	 - propose definition of 'mind' to be "a unit of an intelligent mechanism"
		 - human mind units, mouse mind units, fly mind units
		 - permits quantitative objective measurements of intelligence
	 - traffic light example
 - short proof of feasibility
	 - 
 - conclusion
